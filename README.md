- Historical documentation
- Anthropological studies
- Cultural preservation

## Site Structure

- `index.html` - Homepage with welcome message and Souss-Massa overview
- `lineage.html` - Complete lineage analysis
- `styles.css` - Modern, responsive styling
- `history-my-lineage.txt` - Original research document

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- Modern CSS with custom color scheme reflecting Amazigh heritage
- Accessible typography and navigation
- Timeline visualizations
- Data tables for genetic information
- Image placeholders for future visual content

## Visual Content Recommendations

To replace the current SVG placeholders with actual images, consider these sources:

### ðŸ“¸ **Recommended Images**
- **Souss Valley landscapes** - Aerial views showing Atlas Mountains and Argan forests
- **Chtouka traditional architecture** - Berber villages and kasbahs
- **Argan trees and ecosystem** - Close-ups of Argania spinosa and traditional harvesting
- **Genetic visualization** - Haplogroup distribution maps from research papers
- **Historical artifacts** - Tifinagh scripts, traditional textiles, archaeological sites
- **Cultural elements** - Traditional weaving, pottery, agricultural practices

### ðŸ”— **Free Image Sources**
- **Unsplash** - Search "Morocco Atlas Mountains", "Berber village", "Argan trees"
- **Wikimedia Commons** - Historical maps, archaeological photos, cultural documentation
- **Research Papers** - Many genetic studies include distribution maps (with proper attribution)
- **UNESCO** - Argan Biosphere Reserve documentation
- **Morocco Tourism Board** - Official regional photographs

### ðŸŽ¨ **Current Visual Elements**
- SVG-based geographic representations
- CSS-generated genetic diagrams  
- Animated DNA helixes
- Interactive timeline visualizations
- Responsive design elements

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Replace SVG placeholders with high-quality photographs
- [ ] Add interactive genetic maps with clickable regions
- [ ] Include historical photographs and archaeological evidence
- [ ] Develop multimedia timeline with audio narration
- [ ] Add genealogical tree visualizations with family connections
- [ ] Implement search functionality across genetic and historical data
- [ ] Create downloadable research summaries and citations
